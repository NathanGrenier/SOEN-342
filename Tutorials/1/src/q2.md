# Question 2: Airline management
Consider a system to manage the issuing of tickets for airlines. In this system we are given the following types: Integer, Real, Boolean, Date, Time, and String.

- A flight is associated with several attributes such as date, departure and arrival time, duration and finally with capacity that captures the maximum number of passengers it can accommodate.

- Possibly several flights originate from, or arrive at an airport. Each airport has a unique name.

- An airline handles possibly several flights and a flight can only be handled by a single airline. Each airline maintains a single catalog that holds all tickets that the company issues.

- Passengers may book tickets with several flights. A passenger is associated with a number of attributes such as their name, age and a unique id. A ticket is unique for each passenger-flight pair. In addition, a ticket may be discounted. Every passenger is accompanied by at most one other passenger (for example an underage passenger will be accompanied by an adult). Finally, the system maintains a  hierarchy of passengers by distinguishing between regular and VIP ones.
