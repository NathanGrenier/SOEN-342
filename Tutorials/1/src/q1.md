# Question 1
Consider a software that manages a library. The library maintains a catalog of books.

- Users access a terminal in order to search for books and possibly make a loan. Only one user can access a terminal at a time, and a loan may include no more than 3 items.
- Each **loan** is recorded in the system with its corresponding date, time and the id of the user.
- A record for a book contains a title, an ISBN and a serial number. The library may contain possibly several copies of the same book, and only serial numbers are unique to each copy.
- The library management software system must maintain a record of how many physical copies there are for each book.
## Task 1.1
Given the above description, create a UML domain model.

## Task 1.2
Use Case Make Loan: 
A library clerk indicates to the system that they need to initiate a new loan. They will then proceed to add each loan item by scanning its serial number. For each loan item, the system responds with a confirmation. Upon having scanned all items, the clerk indicates to the system that they need to conclude the 
transaction. 

**Task:**
1. Create a system sequence diagram (SSD) to capture the use case Make Loan.
2. Identify system operations from the SSD above.
   - initiateLoan()
   - scanLoanItem(serialNumber)
   - endLoan()
